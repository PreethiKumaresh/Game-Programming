The title of the game is “The Adventure of Shin Chan” were all the characters are based on the serial called Shin Chan. The Story goes like this where an unknown evil person called Mr. X has captured Shin Chan’s family who wants 10 Diamonds and 8 Keys in order to release his Family. Here the player tries to help Shin Chan to get the above-required things in each level by avoiding all the obstacles.

# LEVEL 1 (Find the Hidden Keys):
Level 1 is based on a puzzle format game where five keys are hidden inside the block. The Player has to find those Keys within the given Ten Chances. If the Playerpicks the wrong block which contains Bomb his score will reduce or else on finding the key his score will increase. All these elements are kept static to make the level 1 easier. If the Player finds all the Keys then the player can go to the next level else the player has to try again.

# LEVEL 2 (Car Fight):
Level 2 is a whole different landscape which is based on a city like a background.Here, the Player has to avoid the cars, ambulance and at the same time, the player has to collect ten Diamonds to complete the first requirement of Mr. X. The score gets increased on collecting the Diamonds. If the Player collides with the car or ambulance his health will get reduced eventually the game gets over and the player has to try again else the level gets completed.

# LEVEL 3 (Rescue Shin Chan’s Family):
Level 3 is a landscape based on a platform-specific game which is present inside the castle. The Platforms are represented in the form of Shin Chan’s name. Here, the player has to avoid the dragon and collect the three flying keys within the given time (120 seconds). The score gets increased on collecting the Coins and Keys. If the player hits the dragon his health will get reduced. On collecting the three keys which completes the second requirement of Mr. X thus the level gets completed, therefore the player helped in
rescuing Shin Chan’s Family else the player has to try again.

# Main Controls:
All the main controls are placed in the OnEnterFrame() method which continuously loops until the program ends. The movement of the player is done by subsequently increasing and decreasing the X &amp; Y axis in which the physical movements like speed, acceleration, friction, and collision is controlled. A special feature in Level 3 is when the player reaches the key due to collision forces the key moves away from the player which makes the game more interesting.

# Software Used:
Adobe Flash CS4 (Flash File - Action Script 3.0)

# Challenges Faced:

# 1) Designing:
Initially, I had different ideas to sketch my game and started to design each level in the form of a storyboard in a paper and tried to bring the scenarios which I needed. So when I implemented in the system it was quite difficult to draw the same idea. But through series of trial and changes, I finally designed the game based on my requirement.

# 2) Coding:
The most difficult part which I faced while developing the game was giving physical movements to the player and providing collision force in which I tried various coding, surfed the net for reference, through series of iteration and critical thinking I was finally able to solve my problems and thus I developed a game of my own.
